* **Secure Dependencies**: We keep our dependencies up-to-date to prevent known vulnerabilities.

## Security Audits

We regularly perform security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. These audits include:

* **Code Reviews**: We review our code regularly to ensure it meets our security standards.
* **Dependency Updates**: We keep our dependencies up-to-date to prevent known vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing**: We perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, we will:

* **Assess the Incident**: We will assess the incident to determine its scope and impact.
* **Notify Affected Parties**: We will notify affected parties, including users and stakeholders, as necessary.
* **Post-Incident Review**: We will perform a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement.

## Security Best Practices

We recommend the following security best practices for users:

* **Use Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
* **Keep Software Up-to-Date**: Keep your software and dependencies up-to-date to prevent known vulnerabilities.
* **Be Cautious with Links and Attachments**: Be cautious when clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown sources.

By following these security policies and procedures, we can ensure the security and integrity of our project and protect our users' data.
